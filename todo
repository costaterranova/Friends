Show me a calendar with people I need to call

Tell me whene there are not many people to call me a calendar with people I need to call
-- tell me how many holes I need to fill in for next week



if not enough it's gonna tell you: there are not enough people for today: add somebody



    Ideally, when you approach that limit, the algorithm tells you: add people!



1) add all future calls to calendar
2) add future text from future_text file
3) add hypothetical future text

4) add event function
